I currently am a Staff Bioinformatics Scientist at [Illumina inc](https://www.illumina.com).

Previously I was a Postdoc at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu) under the supervision of Prof. [Christina Boucher](https://christinaboucher.com/). I am currently working on pangenomics short read alignment. Within this context I developed [MONI](https://github.com/maxrossi91/moni), that is a pangenomic index that can efficiently find maximal exact matches (MEMs) on hundreds of human genomes.

Previously I had a Pre-Postdoc position at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en), where I was a member of the “[Gen­ome-scale al­gorithmics](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/genome-scale-algorithmics)” group under the supervision of Prof. [Veli Mäk­inen](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/genome-scale-algorithmics/people/veli-makinen).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer science from the [University of Verona](https://www.univr.it/), with a thesis on “Algorithms and Data Structures for Coding, Indexing, and Mining of Sequential Data “under the supervision of Prof. [Ferdinando Cicalese](http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=9257) and Prof. [Zsuzsanna Lipták](http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=8756&lang=it).

During my Ph.D. I spent five months at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) in the “[Compressed data structures](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/algorithmic-bioinformatics/compressed-data-structures)” group hosted by Prof. [Simon J. Puglisi](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/puglisi/).

I obtained my MSc In Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Verona and my BSc in Computer Science and Automation Engineering from Marche Polytechnic University.
